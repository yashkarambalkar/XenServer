STEP 9: Click on Finish.

 STEP 10: Click on Citrix XEN Server and Power on this virtual machine.

  STEP 11 Double click on Citrix XEN Server to install it. It will load the XEN installer.

STEP 12: We begin by choosing the keymap.

 :

STEP 13: Assuming you have backed up your data or are doing an install to a fresh disk (or just don’t
care about what’s on there), we hit OK.

STEP 14: It will display End User License Agreement screen. Hit on Accept EULA.

 STEP 15 Here we choose which disk to install to. In a similar way to ESXi, we don’t have the option
of software RAID, so here we choose a single disk or available hardware RAID volume. Press space to
select a drive. Since we are using a NFS datastore on the network to store virtual machines, this is OK.
Moving on.

STEP 16: Now we can key down to OK.

 :

STEP 17: We have the install media here so we will use the Local Media option.

 STEP 18: If you have to ask what a Supplemental Pack is, you don’t have one. Select No. If you select
Yes and don’t have one don’t worry, it won’t harm anything.

STEP 19 You can Skip verification.

 :

STEP 20: It will display the screen for setting the password for root user. Just enter the password &
confirm the password. Then hit on Ok.

 :
STEP 21 The motherboard we are installing to have two Ethernet ports, both of which are supported by
XEN Server. Choose the one you wish to use for the management network – you can change this later.
Here we get to choose the networking settings for our management network. This is the IP address used
for logging in to manage the XEN Server.

STEP 22: Next we choose the hostname and the DNS server settings – if you’re at home you likely use
your gateway IP address.

 :

STEP 23 Pick your country name & then city name.

 STEP 24: Now choose whether to set your time based on an NTP server or on your manual input.

 :

STEP 25 Hit on Install XenServer.

STEP 26: It will show a progress bar so you can see where the install is up to. Once it has done, if you
said you did have supplemental packs you should see.

 STEP 27: Hit Ok to reboot.

 :

 STEP 28: The above is the loading screen for your new XenServer 6.2 install.

STEP 29: Note down IP Address 192.168.232.129.This is the console screen for XenServer
6.2.Installing virtual machine using XenCenter. Open Citrix XenCenter.

STEP 6: Add new server window will popup. Now here enter all the details and click on Add.

 :

STEP 7 Click on Save and restore server connection state on startup. Click on Ok.

STEP 8: Once server is added we will start will virtual machine deployment process.

 STEP 9:
First keep RedHat iso image in one folder; (example we are keeping h-rel62x6.iso RedHat iso image
in Cloud SW folder). Right click on Cloud_SW folder. Click on specific people option from pop
menu.

STEP 10: It will give you “Choose people to share with” screen. Add Everyone.

  STEP 11:

Click on Add button. Give Read/Write permission to Everyone. Then Click on share button.

 STEP 12

: Share path is \\MSCIT-13-PC\Cloud SW. Note down this share path (in place of pc name we
can give ip address of machine also). Click on Done.

 STEP 13:
First we need to create a storage repository where we will store all the iso images of virtual
machine. So for that click on “New Storage” (i.e. Our Own storage for Red hat Linux iso).

058
STEP 14: Select Windows File Sharing (CIFS) option, and then click on Next.

 :

STEP 15: In Name, give any name of your choice.

 STEP 16 In Location, give the path of the shared folder which contains all the images of virtual machine
& Click Finish.

STEP 17: Now we have new storage in which we have all the iso files required for installation of VMs.
So let’s create new virtual machine. For that click on New VM.

 STEP 18: In template field select the name of the virtual machine you want to install. Then in name field
provide name of the virtual machine of your choice.

 STEP 19 In the Installation Media field select the iso image of the VM from the storage repository we
created earlier. Click Next.

 STEP 20: Keep Home Server field unchanged and click Next.

 STEP 21 Provide CPU & Memory details. Click Next.

 Practical No. 7
Aim: Native Virtualization using Hyper-V.
HYPER-V
Hyper-V, codenamed Viridia and formerly known as Windows Server Virtualization,
is a native hypervisor; it can create virtual machines on x86-64 systems. Starting with
Windows 8, Hyper-V supersedes Windows Virtual PC as the hardware virtualization
component of the client editions of Windows NT.
A host server running Hyper-V could be accessed remotely by multiple guest computers.
Each guest computer could perform as if they are using the host server directly. Users on the
guest computers could run applications in the host server remotely, even though that application
is not available on the guest computer.
A beta version of Hyper-V was shipped with certain x86-64 editions of Windows
Server 2008, and a finalized version (automatically updated through Windows Update) was
released on June 26, 2008.[7] Hyper-V has since been released in a free stand-alone version, and
has been upgraded to Release 2 (R2) status.[8][9] It was updated in Windows Server 2012.[10]
The stand-alone Hyper-V Server variant does not require an existing installation of
Windows Server 2008 nor Windows Server 2008 R2. Microsoft Hyper-V server is built with
components of Windows and has a Windows Server Core user experience System
requirements of Microsoft Hyper-V server are the same for supported guest operating systems
and processor, but differ in the following:
RAM: Minimum: 1 GB RAM; Recommended: 2 GB RAM or greater; Maximum 1 TB.
Available disk space: Minimum: 8 GB; Recommended: 20 GB or greater.
